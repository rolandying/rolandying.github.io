I'm currently a doctoral student and junior researcher at [LUT](https://www.lut.fi/en) under the supervising of [Prof. Heikki Handroos](https://www.lut.fi/en/profiles/heikki-handroos) and [Prof. Huapeng Wu](https://www.lut.fi/en/profiles/huapeng-wu). Our team mainly focusing on the `Remote Handling Maintenance System` inside the nuclear fusion reactor. My personal research interests are the Robotic Automation Operations under challenging environments, such as the `robotic grasping`, `peg-in-hole assembly`, `robotic pick-and-place` and so on. 

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
